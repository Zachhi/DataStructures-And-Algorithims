# DataStructures-And-Algorithims
Implementation of every main data structure, as well as Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithm.

**Data structures included**
* ArrayList
* Doubly Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Search tree
* AVL (Self-Balancing) Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Open Addressing Hashtable
* Seperate Chaining Hashtable
* Directed Graph with implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm (finds shortest paths)
* Undirected graph with implementation of Prim's algorithim (finds the minimum spanning tree)

## Demo


### Dependencies



### Installing and Executing

* Download the source code from github, or clone the repository into Visual Studio
* Import into Visual Studio
* Build according to your need (x86 or x64)
* In project settings
  * Add the `/path/to/sfml/include` to your c++ include path
  * Add the `/path/to/sfml/libray` to the linker library path
  * Link the following sfml libraries: `sfml-graphics.lib, sfml-windows.lib, sfml-system.lib, sfml-audio.lib`
  * Link the following debug libraries: `sfml-graphics-d.lib, sfml-windows-d.lib, sfml-system-d.lib, sfml-audio-d.lib`
  * Copy the sfml dlls (in the `sfml/bin` folder) to your project folder
* A very easy and simple 5 minute tutorial for linking SFML with a Visual Studio project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik
* Click the run button at the top and the program should start

**If you would prefer not having to link libraries, and would prefer a version fully set up, see the link at the top**
