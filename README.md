# DataStructures-And-Algorithims
Implementation of every main data structure, as well as Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithm.

**Data structures included**
* ArrayList
* Doubly Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Search tree
* AVL (Self-Balancing) Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Open Addressing Hashtable
* Seperate Chaining Hashtable
* Directed Graph with implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm (finds shortest paths)
* Undirected graph with implementation of Prim's algorithim (finds the minimum spanning tree)

## Demo


### Dependencies

* Some way to compile and execute c++ code
* GNU Make (Not required, but makes executing easier)

### Installing and Executing

* Download the source code from github, or clone the repository into Visual Studio
* Compile code how you like, or, run 'make' in the command line
* After running 'make', execute by running 'run' or './run' depending on your compiler
